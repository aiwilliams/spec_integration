== Rails Spec Integration Plugin

The Spec Integration plugin brings together RSpec on Rails and Rails integration
testing, while also adding a number of very useful new matchers and some more
integration testing DSL methods.

=== Installation

script/plugin install git://github.com/aiwilliams/spec_integration.git

=== Quick Start

It's easy to get started. Create a directory named 'integration' in your spec
directory, right alongside your controllers, models, and views spec
directories. In your spec_helper:

  require 'spec/integration'

A simple integration spec looks like this:

  # in spec/integration/signup_spec.rb
  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../spec_helper"
  
  describe "Logging in" do
    dataset :single_person
    
    it "should send a user to the home page after login" do
      # get the login page
      get "/login"
      response.should be_success
  
      # post the login and follow through to the home page
      post "/login", :username => people(:jamis).username,
        :password => people(:jamis).password
      follow_redirect!
      response.should be_success
      path.should == "/home"
    end
  end

This is taken straight from integration.rb, the Rails integration test
documentation. Of course, it's been modified to specify instead of assert!

=== Integration DSL

Spec Integration adds some great tools to make you even more productive. An
example explains some of these features best.

  # in spec/integration/signup_spec.rb
  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../spec_helper"
  
  describe "Logging in" do
    dataset :single_person
    
    before do
      navigate_to login_path
    end
    
    it "should send a user to the home page after login" do
      submit_form :username => people(:jamis).username,
                  :password => people(:jamis).password
                  
      response.should be_showing(home_path)
    end
  end

The dataset method is provided by another plugin, Dataset(1). It's a
great alternative to fixtures. navigate_to, submit_form, and be_showing are a
few of the DSL methods provided by the Spec Integration plugin.

navigate_to does a get, as in the prior test, but it also follows redirects
and generally ensures that navigating worked - the document isn't missing, the
template rendered, etc.

submit_form posts the parameters (actually, it uses the method defined in the
rendered form's action attribute), follows any redirects, and ensures that all
that was successful. In fact, it does even more. Check out
spec/integration/dsl/form.rb to learn more.

be_showing returns a matcher that ensures the response has the expected path.
